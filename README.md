Files for tutorial on filter context, why it's important, and how to understand it!

If you're serious about learning Power BI, then you'll need to come to grips with a concept known as filter context. Without a proper understanding, you won't get the most out of your Power BI models. It's essential that you learn this.

Luckily, I have written a tutorial to help you understand the concept. It won't be the last tutorial you take on the subject. But it certainly is a good start.
The files for this tutorial are in this repository.

Included:
Filter Context Examples.pbix
data.csv - this file is included in case learners have trouble with exporting during the tutorial.
Widget Sales.xlsx - this is the data for those adverturous types who want to create the model from scratch (see tutorial).
